10. Currency
# Congrats!
Woohoo! You learned variables in Python! ðŸ™Œ

Here's a recap of everything we learned in this chapter:

Data types: int, float, str, bool.
Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /.
The % modulo finds the remainder.
The ** exponentiation finds the exponent.
The input() function is used to get user input.
The int() function converts a value into an integer number.
Let's put it all together now!

Instructions
We just got home from a trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ Colombian pesos
ðŸ‡µðŸ‡ª Peruvian soles
ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazilian reais
Create a currency.py program that asks the user for the amount they have in pesos, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

Make sure to Google the current exchange rates!



The output of the program should look like this:

What do you have left in pesos? 5600
What do you have left in soles? 105
What do you have left in reais? 280
413.0

The sequence should be:

Cha-ching! Now you have the total in USD. ðŸ’°
